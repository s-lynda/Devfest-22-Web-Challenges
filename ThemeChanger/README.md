## Introduction

Themes are the foundation for website design, they establish the overall appearance and determine all design components such as backgrounds, color palettes, and sizing.

## Problem Statement

A startup is launching its new website, built using the holy language HTML&CSS__*of-course*.
But to take this website to the next level, they want to add a `Theme Chooser` functionality and support the following themes ( Dark, Light, and a Blue theme).

You, as a Front-end engineer working on that startup, you're given the task to implement the mentioned functionality respecting the following restrictions:

- The new feature must be implemented using **ONLY HTML&CSS**.
- The implementation must be code-optimized, so it will not require too many changes in case of adding a new theme; so a `base-theme` class is already prepared, and it must cover all themes.
  > You must not create a class for each theme, use the base-theme class
- Adding extra CSS variables is not allowed.
  > The `--bg-color`, `--text-color` must be used for all themes colors variation
- On the initial page load, either a dark theme or light theme will be auto-applied, depending on the user's system settings; _eg: if the user's system theme is dark, the dark theme will be applied automatically on page load_.

## Requirements

1. The implementation must respect all the mentioned restrictions.
2. The delivery must be only **ONE HTML file**(the one given in the starter folder).

## Expectations

- This challenge should take around **15** to **25** minutes to complete.
- We expect a working solution that respects the requirements.

## Notes

1. The boilerplate design is already made on the starter folder, you just need to focus on implementing the new feature.
2. Necessary colors are given on the starter HTML file.


## Evaluation

This challenge has a maximum points of **5** for implementing all the required features.

## Setup

To get you started, we have provided you with a starting point, so you need first to copy to your local environment the `starter` folder you see next to this challenge.
